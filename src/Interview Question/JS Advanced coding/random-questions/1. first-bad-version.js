/**
 * Assume  we have array of good and bad version [G, G, G, B, B, B] and a function which tell the version is good or bad
 * we need to find from where the version  went bad
 * we can call the version from 0 to given version linearly, but it will take O (N)
 * Since the Good and Bad version is sorted, we can find it using Binary search

/**
 * Let keep left as zero and right as version, we need to run a loop from left to right
 * Now find the mid, If the mid is bad then there is chance current mid will be bad or left of it will be bad
 * Here [G, G, G, B, B, B] assume index 4 is bad then there is a chance bad can be index 3 also, so move right = mid -1
 * If the mid is good version, then for sure the bad version will on the right side mid, so left = mid +1
 * At last right will be moved to Good and left will be at bad version, based on that return the answer
