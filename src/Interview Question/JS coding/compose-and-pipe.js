/**
 * Use case: Sometimes we call a function and it returns a value. By using that returned value will call another function. 
 * So here first function output will be used as a input for second function.
 * Only difference between compose and pipe => compose (right to left), pipe (left to right)
 * In angular, we use pipe to process the input data with multiple function and finally return the result 
 */

/**
 * Approach: we need to loop through the function and get its result
 * First with looping the function and store its result in a variable
 * On looping, For first function call the function input and going forward call the previous function result
 * For compose , we need to loop right to left, so reverse the function array
